I recently took the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) certification as I had been slowly working through the course over 6 months. Thankfully, I passed on my first try with a score of 91. It was quite nerve wrecking for me since it's been a long time since I sat for a timed exam.

Many people have already given reviews on how to prepare for this before, so I will not go into too much details, as my exam prep is mostly similar.

I used the following resources:
- <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/">Mumshad Mannambeth's course</a>
- <a href="https://killercoda.com/">Killercoda</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/dgkanatsios/CKAD-exercises">CKAD Exercises Github</a>
- <a href="https://killer.sh/">Killer.sh</a> (Comes free with exam purchase)

The important thing is to practice so that you're familiar with how to edit and write the yaml files, and also to muscle-memory where you can find the information you need from the k8s docs. It is also good to know when to speed up the yaml file generation through the use of imperative commands. Also be sure to double check your k8s context before performing any operations. 

For the exam itself, I used a PC with a 34 inch monitor, wired connection, and external webcam. I arrived 30 mins before my scheduled exam time as allowed by the PSI software. However, I had difficulties with the check in process due to the PSI software not being able to capture my identity card, and also I disconnected halfway during my first check-in session. 

I think the issue with capturing my ID was due to my PC having some virtual webcam sources, and so would recommend un-installing any broadcasting software like Twitch or OBS before taking this exam (or just do the exam on a clean PC). The exam started about 20 mins late, but actual exam was pretty smooth, with no hiccups for me.

As my PC is in my living room, I used bedsheets to cover all the nearby shelves and closed all the doors around me, so the proctor did not need to ask me to remove anything. I also cleared everything that I did not need on my PC table, including my huge mousepad, which was a good thing, as I was asked to lift my keyboard to show that I did not have any paper underneath the keyboard.
